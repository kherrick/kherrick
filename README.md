### Hi there 👋

  - #### [Apps](https://kherrick.github.io/apps/)

    A [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) that aims to adhere to the [App Shell model](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/app-shell). Comprised of several components that operate within the [Angular](https://angular.dev/) framework, the primary routes are [prerendered](https://angular.dev/guide/prerendering) as static HTML during the build process and are [loaded lazily](https://angular.dev/guide/routing/common-router-tasks#lazy-loading) at runtime to ensure a smaller client-side JavaScript bundle. Read more at the [Apps Project Page](https://github.com/kherrick/apps).
